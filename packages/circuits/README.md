# @anon-aadhaar/circuits

These package contains all the circuits and setup that are the core of the Anon Aadhaar protocol.

## Structure

The main logic of the protocol is contained in:

- `src/aadhaar-verifier.circom`: This is the main circuit that encapsulates the core logic of the Anon Aadhaar protocol. It handles the verification process and ensures the integrity and confidentiality of Aadhaar data.

- `src/extractor.circom`: This circuit is responsible for securely extracting and processing relevant information from Aadhaar data.

The circuits in charge of the Sha256 and RSA verification are adapted from the [zk-email](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify/tree/bd4e2412735c09499df93d17cf3180b65711483f) project. We extend our gratitude to zkemail for their exceptional work in this domain.
