 *
 * @returns { [AnonAadhaarState, (request: AnonAadhaarRequest) => void] }
 * An array containing:
 *   - `AnonAadhaarState`: The current state of the Anon Aadhaar authentication process. This includes any relevant
 *     data about the current authentication status, user information, or error states.
